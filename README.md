# Bank Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview

The "Bank Customer Churn Prediction" project focuses on analyzing bank customer data to predict churn behavior. The primary goal is to develop a robust predictive model that helps the bank identify at-risk customers, thus improving customer satisfaction and retention rates.

## Objectives

- To analyze bank customer data for patterns and trends.
- To build a predictive model that accurately forecasts customer churn.
- To provide actionable insights to help the bank retain at-risk customers.

## Methodology

### Data Analysis

Comprehensive analysis of the customer data was performed to understand key features influencing churn behavior.

### Machine Learning Models

- **Random Forest:** A versatile and robust model known for handling complex datasets and interactions between features.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** A powerful classifier that works well with both linear and non-linear data.

### Hyperparameter Tuning

Hyperparameter tuning techniques were employed to optimize the performance of the models. This step ensures that the models provide the most accurate predictions by fine-tuning the parameters that control the learning process.

## Results

The predictive models developed in this project have demonstrated strong performance in identifying potential churners. These insights can be leveraged by the bank to implement targeted retention strategies.

## Conclusion

The project successfully developed a predictive model for customer churn, providing the bank with valuable insights to enhance customer retention strategies. Implementing the recommendations from this analysis can lead to improved customer satisfaction and reduced churn rates.

## Future Work

Future work may include integrating additional data sources, such as customer transaction histories or engagement metrics, to further refine the predictive accuracy of the models.
